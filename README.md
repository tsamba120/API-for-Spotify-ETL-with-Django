# Django API for Spotify ETL Pipeline
## I. Summary
This project is an extension of my Spotify ETL (with Airflow) project. This iteration involves building an API to support the PostgreSQL database at the end of my ETL pipeline.

This project uses the Django web framework to build the API in the back-end.
